        Tailwind is absolutely not required to be scalable, and it is not used by most companies. I agree with youâ€”I prefer being able to look at one place for my styles, rather than having to interpret a bunch of shorthand classes. Others find the opposite; it's really just a matter of opinion. You can make the case that tailwind results in a smaller total css size, since the same classes are reused many times. But personally, I've never found css size to be a major cause of website slowness, so ease of development/maintenance is more important to me. And that means using scoped styles, not tailwind.

        I don't think the question particularly relates to Vue, it's more about if you benefit from tailwind which is case by case scenario. For me, I prefer not to use it, we already have sass mixins for re-usable styles that we can use within the style block, and I don't like the template looking busy with classes and being hard to parse visually. (The same way I don't like the template being full of JS ternary conditions and whatnot, and using computed properties instead always keeps it cleaner)
