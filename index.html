    Submission Procedure 
  </h2>
  <p class="secbody">
   Students take, in succession, three mathematics courses, each compressed into three weeks. While these courses will be demanding, program participants are compensated by their small class size and highly focused approach. In addition to the math sequence, program participants take a French language course, which runs at a normal pace through the quarter, a course designed to help students connect with French (and Parisian) culture.
